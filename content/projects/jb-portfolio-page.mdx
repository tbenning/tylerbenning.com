The Website

The GitHub Repo

A friend of mine had just graduated from school and was started to build out his digital presence to begin applying to jobs. He had bought the domain for joelbott.com but hadn't done much with it yet.

I offered to design and build a single page site to link to his PDF, LinkedIn, and resume. I put together the design, got his stamp of approval, and put together a quick site using some simple HTML/CSS.

I deployed the site using GitHub Pages, and linked it to his domain. It was a fun 1 day self contained project.
