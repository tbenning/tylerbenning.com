I made a modest contribution to the All Contributors open source project. A friend Jake asked for some help to create a logo and landing page to promote the All Contributors Bot he had worked on for the project. 

I designed the logo in illustrator, wrote the copy, and hand coded the page using plain HTML / CSS, all in one day on a Saturday with Jake.
